# Evolution Of Ivermectin Resistance

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks used to simulate and analyze the evolution of ivermectin resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans. The simulations model population genetics and evolutionary dynamics to understand how resistance emerges and spreads under different selective pressures.

## WormFunctions.py 
This is the main file containing all the classes (e.g. Experiment, Population) that are necessary to run the simulations. All details of the experiments are encoded here. 
Individual outputs of the simulations are saved into individual files. 


## EIR_DynamicsFigures.ipynb	
Notebook for generating figures that show the temporal change in population size and resistance frequency.

## EIR_FitnessCurves.ipynb	
Shows the fitness costs and benefits associated with different levels of ivermectin exposure across various genotypes.

## EIR_NumberOfHomozgLoci.ipynb	
Specifically investigates the accumulation of homozygous loci and its dynamics over the course of the simulation
