# Evolution Of Ivermectin Resistance

This repository contains the code used to run simulations of ivermectin resistance evolution in C. elegans and to create the figures. 

## WormFunctions.py 
This is the main file containing all the classes (e.g. Experiment, Population) that are necessary to run the simulations. All details of the experiments are encoded here. 
Individual outputs of the simulations are saved into individual files.
